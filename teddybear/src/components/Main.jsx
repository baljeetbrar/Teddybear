            Count Your Candles Frequently Asked Questions:
            </h3>
            <p>
            <strong>Is it only on their birthday? When can we participate?</strong>
            <br/>
            This offer is available any time in the month of their birthday.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Do I need proof of age?</strong>
            <br/>
            When the birthday child comes into the Workshop, just let us know you’re celebrating a birthday and together we will “count their candles” to let us know how old they are turning. No need to bring in any proof of age or identification.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Do I need to add my child’s birthday into my Build-A-Bear Bonus Club account to participate in Count Your Candles?</strong>
            <br/>
            At this time, you do not need to indicate your child’s birthday in your Bonus Club account. Just visit the Workshop during your child’s birthday month, and we’ll take it from there!
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Do I need to sign up my child for the Build-A-Bear Bonus Club to pay their age for the Birthday Treat Bear?</strong>
            <br/>
            Guests must be 18 years old or older to sign up for Build-A-Bear Bonus Club; therefore, children under 18 are not required to sign up for Bonus Club. They need only accompany a Bonus Club member, or an adult over the age of 18 who signs up to become a Bonus Club member, during the month of their birthday to pay their age for the Birthday Treat Bear.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Is Count Your Candles for any furry friend?</strong>
            <br/>
            The Count Your Candles offer is only available on the new Birthday Treat Bear to mark the special occasion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <strong>Is it online?</strong>
            <br/>
            The Count Your Candles offer is a special experience delivered exclusively at Build-A-Bear Workshop stores.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>What do I need to do to get this offer?</strong>
            <br/>
            The Count Your Candles offer is available to our Bonus Club members! Just sign up online, it’s free and easy! Then you’ll be asked to confirm account details (email address, phone number or account number) at checkout!
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Is a coupon needed?</strong>
            There is no coupon needed for Count Your Candles! Just confirm your Bonus Club account details (email address, phone number or account number) at checkout! Please note: the birthday child must be present to receive the discount.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>Is the Birthday Treat Bear always available?</strong>
            <br/>
            Our intention is to stock the Birthday Treat Bear at all times, but due to inventory availability and delivery issues, it could be possible that some stores could experience inventory outages. To ensure the Birthday Treat Bear is available for your visit, please call your local Workshop to confirm availability before visiting. If we are out of Birthday Treat Bear, the store team will make their best efforts to provide an alternate choice for you.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Do you offer this in all Workshops?</strong>
